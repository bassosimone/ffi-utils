    @brief Measurement Kit Foreign-Function-Interface (FFI) API.

    The FFI API is the basic API exposed by Measurement Kit. This is a C++ API
    callable from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">
    FFI</a> that is meant to be stable across releases of the
    Measurement Kit library. Please, keep in mind the following points when
    reasoning about this FFI API:

    1. everything that is not documented, even if it is exposed via a public
       header file, SHOULD be considered as internal and MAY change without
       further notice;

    2. this is a low-level API, hence:

       - we will tell you when you have ownership of the returned pointers;

       - functions that CAN return NULL MAY return NULL;

       - functions that MAY receive a NULL argument will typically behave
         correctly when passed a NULL argument;

    3. there are more high-level APIs for specific languages, as documented
       in the <a href="https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit/blob/master/include/measurement_kit/README.md">
       FFI API specification</a>.

    Also, note that in this documentation we are going to reference concepts
    such as _tasks_, _task settings_, _events_, etc. that are defined
    <a href="https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit/blob/master/include/measurement_kit/README.md">
    in the FFI API specification</a>.

    @warning This API is not stable yet. We may want to change the names here
    in accordance with a discussion we had merging PR #1640.

/**
    @brief A task that Measurement Kit can run.

    You create a task using mk_task_start(). This function receives as
    argument a serialized JSON containing the task settings. The minimal
    settings JSON contains just the task name, as show in this example:

    ```
    {"name": "Ndt"}
    ```

    Please, see <a href="https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit/blob/master/include/measurement_kit/README.md">
    the FFI API specification</a> for more information regarding the
    schema of the settings as well as on the available task names.

    Creating a Task also creates the thread that will run it. Altough you can
    construct more than one Task at a time, Measurement Kit will make sure that
    tasks do not run concurrently, even though there is no guarantee that they
    will actually run in FIFO order.

    A Task will emit events while running, which you can retrieve using the
    mk_task_wait_for_next_event() call, which blocks until an event occurs. You
    can configure a Task to disable some or all events.

    To know whether a task has finished running, use mk_task_is_done(). This
    will return true when the task thread has exited _and_ there are no unread
    events in the queue drained by mk_task_wait_for_next_event().

    You can also interrupt a running task using mk_task_interrupt().

    The destructor, mk_task_destroy(), will join on the Task thread. That is, it
    will wait for the Task to complete before destroying all the resources.
